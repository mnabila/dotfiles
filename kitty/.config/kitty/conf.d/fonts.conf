#: Fonts {{{

#: kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

font_family      Iosevka
bold_font        auto
italic_font      auto
bold_italic_font auto

#: You can specify different fonts for the bold/italic/bold-italic
#: variants. To get a full list of supported fonts use the `kitty
#: list-fonts` command. By default they are derived automatically, by
#: the OSes font system. Setting them manually is useful for font
#: families that have many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick,
#: etc. For example::

#:     font_family      Operator Mono Book
#:     bold_font        Operator Mono Medium
#:     italic_font      Operator Mono Book Italic
#:     bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium Italic

font_size 12.0

#: Font size (in pts)

force_ltr no

#: kitty does not support BIDI (bidirectional text), however, for RTL
#: scripts, words are automatically displayed in RTL. That is to say,
#: in an RTL script, the words "HELLO WORLD" display in kitty as
#: "WORLD HELLO", and if you try to select a substring of an RTL-
#: shaped string, you will get the character that would be there had
#: the the string been LTR. For example, assuming the Hebrew word
#: ירושלים, selecting the character that on the screen appears to be ם
#: actually writes into the selection buffer the character י.

#: kitty's default behavior is useful in conjunction with a filter to
#: reverse the word order, however, if you wish to manipulate RTL
#: glyphs, it can be very challenging to work with, so this option is
#: provided to turn it off. Furthermore, this option can be used with
#: the command line program GNU FriBidi
#: <https://github.com/fribidi/fribidi#executable> to get BIDI
#: support, because it will force kitty to always treat the text as
#: LTR, which FriBidi expects for terminals.

adjust_line_height  0
adjust_column_width 0

#: Change the size of each character cell kitty renders. You can use
#: either numbers, which are interpreted as pixels or percentages
#: (number followed by %), which are interpreted as percentages of the
#: unmodified values. You can use negative pixels or percentages less
#: than 100% to reduce sizes (but this might cause rendering
#: artifacts).

# symbol_map U+E0A0-U+E0A3,U+E0C0-U+E0C7 PowerlineSymbols

#: Map the specified unicode codepoints to a particular font. Useful
#: if you need special rendering for some symbols, such as for
#: Powerline. Avoids the need for patched fonts. Each unicode code
#: point is specified in the form U+<code point in hexadecimal>. You
#: can specify multiple code points, separated by commas and ranges
#: separated by hyphens. symbol_map itself can be specified multiple
#: times. Syntax is::

#:     symbol_map codepoints Font Family Name

disable_ligatures always

#: Choose how you want to handle multi-character ligatures. The
#: default is to always render them.  You can tell kitty to not render
#: them when the cursor is over them by using cursor to make editing
#: easier, or have kitty never render them at all by using always, if
#: you don't like them. The ligature strategy can be set per-window
#: either using the kitty remote control facility or by defining
#: shortcuts for it in kitty.conf, for example::

#:     map alt+1 disable_ligatures_in active always
#:     map alt+2 disable_ligatures_in all never
#:     map alt+3 disable_ligatures_in tab cursor

#: Note that this refers to programming ligatures, typically
#: implemented using the calt OpenType feature. For disabling general
#: ligatures, use the font_features setting.

font_features none

#: Choose exactly which OpenType features to enable or disable. This
#: is useful as some fonts might have features worthwhile in a
#: terminal. For example, Fira Code Retina includes a discretionary
#: feature, zero, which in that font changes the appearance of the
#: zero (0), to make it more easily distinguishable from Ø. Fira Code
#: Retina also includes other discretionary features known as
#: Stylistic Sets which have the tags ss01 through ss20.

#: Note that this code is indexed by PostScript name, and not the font
#: family. This allows you to define very precise feature settings;
#: e.g. you can disable a feature in the italic font but not in the
#: regular font.

#: To get the PostScript name for a font, use kitty + list-fonts
#: --psnames:

#: .. code-block:: sh

#:     $ kitty + list-fonts --psnames | grep Fira
#:     Fira Code
#:     Fira Code Bold (FiraCode-Bold)
#:     Fira Code Light (FiraCode-Light)
#:     Fira Code Medium (FiraCode-Medium)
#:     Fira Code Regular (FiraCode-Regular)
#:     Fira Code Retina (FiraCode-Retina)

#: The part in brackets is the PostScript name.

#: Enable alternate zero and oldstyle numerals::

#:     font_features FiraCode-Retina +zero +onum

#: Enable only alternate zero::

#:     font_features FiraCode-Retina +zero

#: Disable the normal ligatures, but keep the calt feature which (in
#: this font) breaks up monotony::

#:     font_features TT2020StyleB-Regular -liga +calt

#: In conjunction with force_ltr, you may want to disable Arabic
#: shaping entirely, and only look at their isolated forms if they
#: show up in a document. You can do this with e.g.::

#:     font_features UnifontMedium +isol -medi -fina -init

box_drawing_scale 0.001, 1, 1.5, 2

#: Change the sizes of the lines used for the box drawing unicode
#: characters These values are in pts. They will be scaled by the
#: monitor DPI to arrive at a pixel value. There must be four values
#: corresponding to thin, normal, thick, and very thick lines.
