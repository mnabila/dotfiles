#: Scrollback {{{

scrollback_lines 2000

#: Number of lines of history to keep in memory for scrolling back.
#: Memory is allocated on demand. Negative numbers are (effectively)
#: infinite scrollback. Note that using very large scrollback is not
#: recommended as it can slow down performance of the terminal and
#: also use large amounts of RAM. Instead, consider using
#: scrollback_pager_history_size. Note that on config reload if this
#: is changed it will only affect newly created windows, not existing
#: ones.

scrollback_pager less --chop-long-lines --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS +INPUT_LINE_NUMBER

#: Program with which to view scrollback in a new window. The
#: scrollback buffer is passed as STDIN to this program. If you change
#: it, make sure the program you use can handle ANSI escape sequences
#: for colors and text formatting. INPUT_LINE_NUMBER in the command
#: line above will be replaced by an integer representing which line
#: should be at the top of the screen. Similarly CURSOR_LINE and
#: CURSOR_COLUMN will be replaced by the current cursor position.

scrollback_pager_history_size 0

#: Separate scrollback history size, used only for browsing the
#: scrollback buffer (in MB). This separate buffer is not available
#: for interactive scrolling but will be piped to the pager program
#: when viewing scrollback buffer in a separate window. The current
#: implementation stores the data in UTF-8, so approximatively 10000
#: lines per megabyte at 100 chars per line, for pure ASCII text,
#: unformatted text. A value of zero or less disables this feature.
#: The maximum allowed size is 4GB. Note that on config reload if this
#: is changed it will only affect newly created windows, not existing
#: ones.

scrollback_fill_enlarged_window no

#: Fill new space with lines from the scrollback buffer after
#: enlarging a window.

wheel_scroll_multiplier 5.0

#: Modify the amount scrolled by the mouse wheel. Note this is only
#: used for low precision scrolling devices, not for high precision
#: scrolling on platforms such as macOS and Wayland. Use negative
#: numbers to change scroll direction.

touch_scroll_multiplier 1.0

#: Modify the amount scrolled by a touchpad. Note this is only used
#: for high precision scrolling devices on platforms such as macOS and
#: Wayland. Use negative numbers to change scroll direction.
